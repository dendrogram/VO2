This App was designed to replace an earlier PC Program Written by David Glover (Tech) and Grant Rockley (Tech).  This App was designed by Jonathan A. Howell (Tech) and uses calculations that are standard for Exercise Physiology since the 1960's.  David J. Egan et al wrote GasCalc.xls for PC/Mac systems with Excel(R), and this App's data results' agree with those calculations and output from GasCalc.  Take the time to examine the 'About' pages in the App for more details on the calculations.
